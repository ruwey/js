					If you want to change that variable, you can use mathematical operators to update it.
					
					x = x + 3;
					
					There are, however, some shortcuts.  This first one allows you to add 3 to the value of the variable without having to repeat its name.
					
					x += 3;
					
					The second one adds 1 to the variable.  You can use ++ and -- to add or subtract one from any variable.  These two shortcuts are very specific and only work to ADD ONE or SUBTRACT ONE.

				display

				It's very important, as a programmer, that you distinguish between your back end, the variables and working parts of the program, and the front end, the display and the interface.
				
				In this program, I have created a back end variable (myNumber) that represents the changing number.
				
				The display function takes that number, whatever it is, and copies its value into the innerHTML of numberOutput, an HTML element (an h1).
				
				The output IS NOT the number.  It is a way to show the number.  Think of it like this.  If you are happy, you smile.  If you are angry, you frown.  The smile and the frown are not your emotions.  They are a display of your emotions on your face.
				
				numberOutput.innerHTML is NOT the number.  It is simply a way to display the number.
